<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm originally a petroleum engineer who found her passion in coding and web development. It all started with a subject I took back at university, it was called MATLAB. That was my introduction to coding, and I spent hours and hours making different programs.</p>

<p>I'm a person who loves challenges, and nothing gives me great happiness other than solving a difficult challenge. That's what I love about coding, you will always be solving different problems and challenges and finally you will feel great satisfaction.</p>

<p>I always asked my self what makes a great website, what makes my journey in the website enjoyable and the answer was UX. Having a great UX will ensure your customers enjoy their journey and making it to the purchase page. And I ensure you, I will give you that.</p>
